Possessions become important and we attach more value to them than to objects that we don't own. The effect in which individuals evaluate objects that they possess or imagine to possess is known as the mere ownership effect or the endowment effect. Essentially, this effect suggests that simply having something makes us see it as being better and having more positive attributes than another object that we do not have. This applies to things that have emotional value and those that do not. What is more, it also applies to symbols and other non-material ideas or concepts. If we make it ours, we will think of it as being better. </span></p></div>

							<div class="cont-148"><p class="para-40"><span class="font-40">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="para-41"><span class="font-41">The explanation behind this idea is related to associations. When we have ownership of an object or claim an idea as ours, we make an association between ourselves and the object or idea. The object is related to us, so the view that exists of this object has an effect on how we view ourselves on some level. </span></p><p class="para-42"><span class="font-42">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="para-43"><span class="font-43">Generally speaking, we want to have a positive view of ourselves, so that makes us enhance the view we have of those objects. In short, our motivation to view ourselves in a positive light also makes us, unconsciously, view everything we associate with ourselves, including things we own, as being positive or better than other things.</span></p></div>

The regions that were activated were those that had to do with cognitive control processes. </span></p><p class="para-57"><span class="font-57">These findings suggest that the mere ownership effect can appear in two different ways depending on whether there is or is not a threat to self-esteem. These conditions might seem artificial, but refer to different motivational situations. In one case, where there is no threat to a person's self-esteem, the person will still evaluate more positively the thing that they own. However, if there is a threat, more processes are engaged and different areas of the brain become active. </span></p></div>

In general, the person might only express a stronger preference for the car that they already own.</span></p><p class="para-62"><span class="font-62">If a person is asked to choose between the two models, but with an added suggestion that the car that the person already owns is poor and an unsensible choice, it's likely that the person will perceieve this as a threat to their self-esteem and respond to the situation differently. A person might engage on a more cognitive level or react with a stronger desire to defend their choice.</span></p><p class="para-63"><span class="font-63">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="para-64"><span class="font-64">The mere ownership effect, in short, can manifest through two very different neurobiological processes depending on whether or not there is a threat to the self-esteem of the person who is experiencing the mere ownership effect.</span></p></div>
